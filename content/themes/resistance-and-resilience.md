  The “color line,” which the Black scholar W. E. B. Du Bois described as “the problem of the twentieth century,” was not just a conceptual line between groups of people but very often a cartographic line, a space of both racist confrontation and demands for liberation.

      The sponsor of this bird’s-eye view—the Cunard Steamship Company—and the emphasis on the docks in the foreground of the map are both reminders of the role that immigration has played in the history of the East Boston neighborhood. At the time this map was published, the list of churches on the right side of the title hinted at the neighborhood’s diversity, with institutions like Congregational and Unitarian meeting houses sharing space with immigrants’ Methodist, Baptist, and Roman Catholic churches. Like much of Boston at this time, Irish Catholic immigrants made up the largest single group of newcomers. In 1920, the United States government would set up an immigration control station on the East Boston waterfront, at a time when racist ideas about different ethnic groups were contributing to tightened restrictions on immigration. Today, East Boston is a thriving center of the city’s Hispanic community.

      In response to the exploitative living and working conditions facing many immigrants, reformers in the late nineteenth century founded “settlement houses,” volunteer social service agencies with the goal of improving impoverished urban districts. Settlement workers produced some of the first detailed maps to study socioeconomic and demographic conditions—the most famous of which were the Hull House maps of Chicago. In Boston, the South End House created similar maps documenting multi-ethnic, working-class neighborhoods. These maps of the South End from the 1898 book _The City Wilderness_ show the sorts of urban phenomena that interested the reformers. In the map of “predominant race factors,” they observed how different groups clustered together in blocks, while the map of “industrial character” examined the composition of the labor force. Other maps took stock of building types and social institutions. While the middle-class reformers had many well-intentioned plans to bring resources to these neighborhoods, their exoticizing treatment of an urban “wilderness” often jostled uncomfortably with the efforts of immigrants and laborers to form their own social movements.

Despite its reputation as a hotbed for abolitionist sentiment in the nineteenth century, Boston never fully granted its Black population substantive political and economic equality. The city had a small but segregated Black population before the Civil War, which grew in the early twentieth century as Black families moved from the U.S. South as well as from overseas. While Boston and Massachusetts had relatively few outright legal restrictions on where Black people could live, a more sinister pattern of racist exclusion stood in the way of both spatial and social integration. In the years after World War II, as white people and their money increasingly fled outside of city lines to the car-dependent suburbs, the neighborhoods where Black residents lived suffered from disinvestment. Fights over school boundaries and where to direct redevelopment funds illustrated just how entrenched the “color line” had become in Boston. Political and social struggles to build a more just racial geography in the Boston region are ongoing today, even as contemporary maps continue to document stark racial inequalities.
